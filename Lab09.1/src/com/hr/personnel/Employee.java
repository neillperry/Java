 * The Employee class is a fairly simple class.  It mainly serves as a simple 
 * superclass to illustrate inheritance.
 * 
 * Employee includes the following properties:
 *   String name
 *   LocalDate hireDate - LocalDate is a Java 8 Date class.
 *  
 *  Employee includes the following methods (besides get/set methods)
 *  void work(): Just outputs string to show it was called.
 *  String toString(): Generates string from Employee object.
